# react-native-activity-kit

Looking for developers to collaberate on a react native wrapper for the new ios activity kit introduced in ios 16. It is currently in beta with apple but would be awesome to bring it to react native!

This is my first open sourced repository, I'm looking to collaborate and meet other developers. 

Open a new issue if you'd like to discuss this project!
